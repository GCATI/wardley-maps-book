# Welcome
This is an Asciidoc book of Simon Wardley's "Wardley Maps". It simply takes all his [medium posts](https://medium.com/wardleymaps) and joins them together for ease of reading.  The intention is to update the content regulary. Fix all the spelling and grammar errors.  It is made available under the same Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike-4.0-International licence as the original posts.

# Training & Certifications
This content will be the official body of knowledge for all GCATI Wardley Mapping training and certifications. [GCATI Wardley Mapping Training](https://gcati.org/community/wardley-mapping-community)

# Contributing
Contributions are cool, and also very welcome.  There is a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and a [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) which you can familiarise yourself with if you want to get involved (even if its just fixing a typo).  They should be _very_ unsurprising to anyone used to the OSS world.

# To Do
* Update the book with the latest content and knowledge from Simon Wardley
* Fix xref rendering on .mobi (Kindle) file generation - it doesn't work
* Replace the formulae image in chapter 19 with the latex equivalent (https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-latex)
* Change the type-setting so that paragraphs in the ```.mobi``` output aren't indented
